# LSTM-Attention Model for Music Generation

In this notebook, we will focus upon:
+ Data preparation steps for music generation.
+ We will use a subset of MIDI files from the dataset collected by reddit user ``u/midi_man``. The dataset is available here for reference: [reddit-link](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/3ajwe4/the_largest_midi_collection_on_the_internet/)
+ Sequence Preparation steps
+ Stacked LSTM with attention based model
+ Train and generate model
